## Digital barometric altimeter
This repository contains Arduino Nano based barometric altimeter project description.

# Introduction
This barometric altimeter is a small device which can measure current altitude using atmospheric pressure detection. 

Here is a list of electronic components used in this project:
  1. Arduino Nano board (https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano?queryID=fc006532adfc9cd109270b2609e022f7)
  2. BMP280 (I2C version) (https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/adafruit-bmp280-barometric-pressure-plus-temperature-sensor-breakout.pdf)
  3. 

Here is a list of official Arduino libraries used in this project:
  1. Adafruit BMP280 Library (https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/adafruit-bmp280-library/)
  2. LiquidCrystal I2C (https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/liquidcrystal-i2c/)
  3. SD (https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/sd/)
  4. SPI (https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/spi/)
  5. TimerOne (https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/timerone/)

Arduino Nano must be connected with BMP280 sensor, SD card module, LCD display and rotary encoder.
