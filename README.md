# Digital barometric altimeter
This repository contains a program for Arduino Nano based barometric altimeter. 
Here is a list of electronic components used in this project:
  1. Arduino Nano board (https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano?queryID=fc006532adfc9cd109270b2609e022f7)
  2. BMP280 (I2C version) (https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/adafruit-bmp280-barometric-pressure-plus-temperature-sensor-breakout.pdf)
  3. 

Here is a list of official Arduino libraries used in this project:
  1. 

Arduino Nano must be connected with BMP280 sensor, SD card module, LCD display and rotary encoder.
